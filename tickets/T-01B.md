    # T-01B: Freeze ID scheme + enforce across schemas/DB/CLI

    ## Goal
    Make IDs deterministic and unambiguous so the tool is safe to automate and test.

    ## Deliverables
    - `specs/id-scheme.md` treated as authoritative
- Update schemas to validate ID formats where applicable
- Update DB schema to store item IDs as TEXT primary keys (or with UNIQUE constraints)
- Update CLI outputs to use item IDs everywhere (review, reports, events)


    ## Acceptance criteria
    - All item IDs follow regexes in `specs/id-scheme.md`
- Dataset import uses deterministic ID computation and is idempotent
- BDD scenarios use valid IDs and remain in sync with contract


    ## Test plan (RGR)
    - Unit: ID generation and normalization tests
- Contract: schema validation includes ID format constraints
