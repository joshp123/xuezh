    # T-13: Skill refinement + examples aligned to final CLI contract

    ## Goal
    Ensure Skill prompt is accurate, concise, and drives the CLI correctly.

    ## Deliverables
    - Update `skills/chinese-learning-orchestrator/SKILL.md` to match final command flags and schema names
- Add more examples (review, tone loop, graded story constraints)
- Ensure frontmatter is valid for Anthropic Skills (name/description only)


    ## Acceptance criteria
    - Skill references only implemented commands
- Examples are copy/paste-able and produce valid JSON envelopes


    ## Test plan (RGR)
    - Manual: run example commands and validate outputs
- Integration: optional lint to ensure referenced commands exist
