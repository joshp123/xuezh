    # T-04B: Select upstream HSK dataset + provenance (source, version, licensing)

    ## Goal
    Choose the canonical upstream HSK dataset so reports and audits reflect real data and legal provenance.

    ## Deliverables
    - Decide primary HSK dataset source(s) for vocab/grammar (and chars if included)
    - Record source URLs, version identifiers, and license terms in `specs/datasets/provenance.md`
    - Capture any required preprocessing steps (format normalization only)
    - Provide a small local snapshot under `specs/datasets/` or `tests/fixtures/` (if licensing allows)

    ## Acceptance criteria
    - User approves the selected dataset source(s) and licensing constraints
    - Provenance doc updated with version + license
    - Report planning references only the approved dataset(s)

    ## Test plan (RGR)
    - Manual: verify provenance doc completeness and source accessibility
