    # T-06B: Event logging primitives (exposures) + snapshot integration

    ## Goal
    Record primary-source exposure events so the model can plan i+1 and recency-aware sessions.

    ## Deliverables
    - SQLite `events` table (append-only)
- CLI:
  - `xuezh event log ...`
  - `xuezh event list ...`
- Snapshot includes bounded recent events + exposure counts by modality


    ## Acceptance criteria
    - Events are facts; no scoring or recommendations
- `event list` ordering is deterministic (ts + id)
- BDD `events.feature` passes


    ## Test plan (RGR)
    - Integration: log event then list event
- Unit: parsing items list / items-file safely
