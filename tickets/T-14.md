    # T-14: Operational polish: doctor/export/logging + backups

    ## Goal
    Make the engine robust for daily use and easy to debug.

    ## Deliverables
    - `xuezh doctor` prints resolved paths, tool availability, db status
- `xuezh export` produces weekly export artifacts (json/csv) in workspace
- Structured logs and event journal pointers
- Backup command (mechanical) or automatic on db init/close


    ## Acceptance criteria
    - Engine is debuggable without reading code
- Exports are bounded and stored as artifacts


    ## Test plan (RGR)
    - Integration: `doctor` output envelope
- E2E: export creates files in workspace


## Notes
Implemented `doctor` diagnostics command with workspace/db/tool checks.
Export/logging/backups deferred because no CLI contract exists for those commands.
