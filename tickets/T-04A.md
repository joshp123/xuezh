    # T-04A: HSK scope & schema hold point (vocab+grammar, chars optional) — user sign-off required

    ## Goal
    Freeze the HSK audit structure so reports remain stable and correct.

    ## Deliverables
    - `specs/hsk-scope.md` reviewed and approved
- `schemas/report.hsk.schema.json` updated to match scope
- `docs/cli-contract.md` updated (if needed)


    ## Acceptance criteria
    - Agent produces a sample `report.hsk` JSON structure using fixtures and requests user approval
- Once approved, schema/contract/BDD are updated to match and frozen


    ## Test plan (RGR)
    - Contract sync tests pass
- Schema validation enforces coverage.vocab and coverage.grammar


## Notes
This ticket is a deliberate stop-the-line gate to avoid implementing the wrong HSK interpretation.
