    # T-04A: HSK scope & schema hold point (vocab+grammar only) — user sign-off required

    ## Goal
    Freeze the HSK audit structure based on *real* upstream datasets (not fixtures).

    ## Deliverables
    - Import real upstream dataset(s) (ivankra/hsk30) into a temp workspace
- Produce a sample `report.hsk` JSON structure *from actual dataset counts*
- `specs/hsk-scope.md` reviewed and approved
- `schemas/report.hsk.schema.json` updated to match scope
- `docs/cli-contract.md` updated (if needed)


    ## Acceptance criteria
    - Agent produces a sample `report.hsk` JSON structure using the real dataset and requests user approval
- Once approved, schema/contract/BDD are updated to match and frozen


    ## Test plan (RGR)
    - Contract sync tests pass
- Schema validation enforces coverage.vocab and coverage.grammar


## Notes
This ticket is a deliberate stop-the-line gate to avoid implementing the wrong HSK interpretation.
Approved scope (2025-12-19):
- Vocab + grammar only (no chars in v1).
- Import only levels 1–6; exclude upstream 7–9 rows for now.
- Use CEDICT in `notes`, leave `meanings` empty (no English glosses).
- Grammar mapping: Category -> title, Details -> pattern, Content -> examples.
