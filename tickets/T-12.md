    # T-12: Test fixtures + golden traces for CLI (integration + e2e)

    ## Goal
    Add fixtures and golden outputs to enable autonomous regression checks.

    ## Deliverables
    - `tests/fixtures/`:
  - minimal HSK dataset files
  - sample DB seed scripts
  - small sample audio files (if feasible) or mocked outputs
- Golden JSON files for:
  - snapshot
  - report hsk
  - review start/grade
  - audio process-voice


    ## Acceptance criteria
    - `pytest` runs end-to-end flows deterministically
- Golden files updated intentionally when schema changes


    ## Test plan (RGR)
    - E2E: run full flow and compare to golden outputs


## Notes
Added golden traces + e2e comparison test with deterministic clock.
Added seed SQL fixture and golden JSON outputs for snapshot, reports, review, and audio process-voice.
