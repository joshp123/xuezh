    # T-07: Reports v1: HSK audit + mastery facts + progress metrics

    ## Goal
    Provide bounded, auditable reports used by the model for decisions.

    ## Deliverables
    - `xuezh report hsk --level L --window W --max-items N`
  - coverage, recency distribution, bounded evidence rows
- `xuezh report mastery --item-type character|word|grammar --window W --max-items N`
  - facts: last_seen, times_seen, success rates, due_at, pronunciation stats
- `xuezh report progress --window W`
  - time spent (if tracked), retention aggregates, pronunciation trends


    ## Acceptance criteria
    - Reports are bounded; spill to artifact when needed
- Evidence rows have stable ordering
- Reports contain facts only (no recommendations)


    ## Test plan (RGR)
    - Integration: run each report against fixture DB and validate schema
- Unit: forbidden keys checks (BDD-ZFC)
