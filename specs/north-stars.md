## NS-1 (Primary): “Git gud at Chinese with low effort”
The system should help the learner improve Chinese via short, frequent, enjoyable sessions,
emphasizing natural acquisition, comprehensible input (i+1), and speaking practice.

## NS-2 (Secondary): “HSK-aligned mastery instrumentation”
The engine must be able to produce bounded audits and evidence about:
- coverage of HSK levels (vocab + grammar; chars optional)
- recency distributions
- modality splits (recognition vs production vs pronunciation)
without recommending what to do next (LLM does that).

## NS-3 (Engineering): ZFC/Unix compliance
The engine is a thin deterministic shell. All pedagogical reasoning lives in the model and the Skill.
